1. Statically Typed (Type must be defined at compile time)
2. Strong Typed (Type of a var cannot change)
3. GO is compiled
4. Fast compile time (Code -> Binary)
5. Built in concurrency (Goroutine)
6. Simple (Garbage Collection)

packages - Folder with go files
modules - Collection of packages


Commands:

go mod init go_tutorials
go build -o bin/main tutorials/main.go
./bin/main

go run tutorials/main.go  (Compile and Run) - No exe generated


array - fixed length, same type, indexable, contiguous in memory
slice - array + additional funtionality - more general, powerful and convenient interface
// initiallizing slice with initial capacity has better performance


strings
- array of utf-8 encoded bytes
- immutable

utf-8 encoding = strings in go
ascii = 7 bits = 128 chars
utf-32 = 32 bits = lots of unused bits
utf-8 = variable length encoding

ascii = 1 byte = 0xxx...
Ã© = 233 unicode point number = 2 bytes = 11000011 10101001
